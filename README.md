Super Rugby Pacific 2025 is set for a fierce and landmark one-off clash between Blues and Crusaders. The two teams have played with spirit and skill in their previous two matches.
However, the latest game shows that the customer is the latest client of the date (October 2023).
Blues vs Crusaders live, April 22–Eden Park, April 25. The answer is clear: 3028, because of the Crusader's offensive victory. tried (totaling 6) for Preston, Fihaki and Reece. Kemara converted a handful of those passes. Finlay Christie and Dalton Papalii dotted down to put the Blues on the scoreboard. But that approach was so much more effective that the Crusaders were able to cover their tracks. The Crusaders led the Blues in runs, meters, clean breaks, defenders beaten and stops. To some extent, they prevailed.
Crusaders 42-17 Blues (Lee 8, 17; Hurrifield 46, 48, 59; Chavchavadze 38) Eden Park, January 4, 2025 Too many efforts, some decent set-plays and a handful of wonderfully executed kicks. Some bullish carrying from Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie sent the Crusaders darting into the competition, 12–0 up, in next to no time. The Crusaders are a far bigger physical threat than ever a Blues team could throw.’ Ultimately, it was the Crusaders who were in control of the match.
They beat Blues 41–19 when they faced off at Eden Park on March 19, 2025. All the while, experts were stronger but by playing the safe defense, the easily-breakable Kingdoms line up could have been a little harder to be shattered. Williams, Havili and Fihaki powered the offensive onslaught, which the Blues could not stop. Blues' early dominance on the game couldn't stop their more selfless side from turning chances to points.
The historian and the invader:
Not many two sides have clashed more often than the Blues and Crusaders in the 42 years of Super Rugby. In forty-five Super Rugby matches against the Crusaders in the four-two years they have now faced each other, the Crusaders have thirty-two wins, twelve losses and one draw. The Crusaders, who struggled with Pro12 confidence all season, have been brilliant over their last 18 games, taking 17 of them to clinch the title.
The traits of this long standing rivalry have developed into narrow contests, stout playoff performances and a bit of “bad blood,” which now and then fuses with the usual healthy respect a worthy adversary deserves. Yesterday, in the closing moments of the Plunket Shield, the Crusaders outlasted a thirty, far from the precision of the 2022 Super Rugby final at Eden Park, to gun for their eleventh championship. Somehow, after all these years, it may just finally be the year the Blues break the run.
Directly sparring between Barrett and Mo’unga has all but settled it, and it’s all to play for. These rivals have positioned themselves at the forefront of the meetings taking place.
STATISTICS AND RESULTS: 25-Team
The Crusaders have scored more runs (1048 to 982) and made more clean breaks (66 to 41) but they also faced more defenders and tacklers (215 to 162).
With a four-year cycle beginning, however, Rob Penney and his support team have been doing a fantastic job of getting their players right every week.
Finally,

Competing for the Super Rugby Pacific crown has been physically taxing, strategically intense and emotionally draining. While the Crusaders get more wins lately, the Blues (6) are a good team and could prove a potential threat
